INSERT INTO `item` VALUES ('4', '4073', 'About\n\n What is mimicArm?\n\nmimicArm is a programmable collaborative A.I. robot. Using a building block approach to teaching, users will learn complex robotics programming in a gradual frustration-free way. As soon as it\'s constructed mimicArm works in manual mode and can execute pre-programmed example programs. Thanks to the intuitive nature of mimicArm, children as young as five can start using mimicArm right away.\n\nmimicArm Robots in Blue, Green, and Orange\nmimicArm Robots in Blue, Green, and Orange\nWhen the user is ready to start programming on their own mimicBlock offers a simple drag-and-drop programming environment. More complex programs can be written in C to perform more complex robotic tasks. Learn more about mimicArm here. There are plenty of educational robots out there, but mimicArm is the only true k-12+ robot available. No other educational robot combines the simplicity required for young students with the capability required for more experienced users.\n\nOther robots teach robotics of today.  mimicArm teaches robotics of tomorrow.\nOther robots teach robotics of today. mimicArm teaches robotics of tomorrow.\nWhat Does mimicArm do?\nAs a programmable A.I. collaborative robot (or cobot), mimicArm is a fun way to learn robotics and the foundations of programming robot/human interactions, robot decision making, and machine learning. mimicArm is fun and engaging from the very start. As soon as mimicArm is assembled the user can start using mimicArm in manual mode. Adding the scribbleBot attachment is even more fun.\n\nscribbleBot is always a fun!\nscribbleBot is always a fun!\nWhen the user is ready to start programming, pre-programmed examples ensure that users are able to start fast. The mimicBlock graphical programming language makes it easy for kids to load and alter programs from our website or write programs of their own. (You can download mimicBlock BETA now to see how it works). mimicBlock is similar to other programming curricula commonly used in classrooms and STEAM camps across the world, so it makes a great complement to other tools the user might be using. After learning the basics in mimicBlock more advanced programs can be written in C. These examples get pretty sophisticated, and you can learn more about them here.\n\nprogramming software builds the users abilities gradually\nprogramming software builds the users abilities gradually\nWhat Makes mimicArm Unique?\nIn manual mode mimicArm uses our patent pending Posi-Feel(tm) technology (learn more), which gives the user intuitive haptic feedback and allows sophisticated delicate manipulation not possible on other servo based robots. This not only provides intuitive feel, reducing operator frustration, but also allows the user to manipulate a variety of objects, from strong and heavy to very fragile. The inputBox (included in our Deluxe kit) comes pre-programmed to allow the user to use different inputs to interact with mimicArm right away. As the user learns to program mimicArm to perform ever more complex tasks they can develop a unique personality for their mimicArm based on the programming choices they make.\n\nThere are other robots designed to teach programming, but only mimicArm is uniquely designed to teach interaction between robot and human. Through its unique design and combinations of sensors mimicArm is able to sense it\'s environment in such a way as to understand what a human is asking it to do. At the simplest, mimicArm can tell if it has grabbed a block it\'s been offered, while at it\'s most complex mimicArm is able to detect and reach for blocks, sort by size, communicate it\'s status, and receive instructions through a microphone or button. It\'s a great choice for everyone from robot novice to veteran programmer.\n\nNever programmed before? No problem! When you\'re ready, our simple yet powerful programming software gradually eases you into programming concepts and our downloadable experiments start simple to guide you every step of the way. The mimicArm circuit board takes care of the tough control system tasks so the user can program with simple intuitive commands like robotMove or robotGrab. The experiments incrementally increase in complexity until you\'re able to program using genuine C code just like the professionals, and your mimicArm becomes a genuine collaborative robot, capable of making decisions and learning. Want to pick up delicate objects without breaking them? mimicArm can do that. Want to record and playback a dance? mimicArm can do that. Need a shop assistant to hold your soldering iron? mimicArm can do that too. Add our available accessories and even more possibilities emerge.\n\ninputBox opens up a world of interactive possibilities inputBox opens up a world of interactive possibilities\ninputBox opens up a world of interactive possibilities inputBox opens up a world of interactive possibilities\nmimicArm is the only k-12 educational robot available. mimicArm leverages the popular Arduino microcontrollers and programming environment for nearly infinite expandability as the user’s abilities grow. Want to make mimicArm remote controlled? Use the remote included in our inputBox! Want to record and playback your motions? Use the inputBox microSD card! Want mimicArm to detect and move blocks? Use our IR Distance Sensor! Check out our Experiments Page for examples. Using these capabilities you can take mimicArm from a simple manually controlled robot all the way to an artificial intelligence machine capable of decision making and human interaction.\n\nThat Sounds Great! Which Kit is Right for Me?\nEverything you need to learn artifical inteligence programming\nEverything you need to learn artifical inteligence programming\nAll of our mimicArm kits allow the user to get started in manual mode as soon as they’re assembled, come pre-programmed with simple A.I. examples, and are programmable. mimicArm kits are designed for easy assembly. Using the included wrench, screwdriver, and hex key you can fully assembl your mimicArm in a couple of hours. (Younger users will need an adult’s help).

Working with people around the world, Public Lab has developed an affordable way to peek into this hidden world.\n\n\nUsing simple materials, we’ve developed a kit you can build yourself - the result of many teams’ work coming together! Introducing the Community Microscope:\n\n\nIt takes only fifteen minutes to build, and plugs into a smartphone or laptop. It’s a simple but elegant design -- you focus it by tightening the bolts, and the basic version is made from a webcam with its lens flipped upside down.\n\nPublic Lab is an open community of activists, tinkerers, organizers, makers, educators and scientists around the world, who have worked together to design this kit. We’ve worked with a growing coalition to take a Do-It-Yourself approach to environmental justice issues.\n\nWe welcome you to join in making these techniques more accessible!\n\n\nThe Community Microscope Kit\n\nWe’re offering a range of options with mix-and-match components -- start with the intro kit and we\'ll be offering upgrade kits after the campaign.\n \nThe Intro Kit\n\nThis kit is very simple: a webcam, a platform of corrugated plastic, a set of nuts, bolts & rubber bands, and some double-sided adhesive strips! With it, you can easily see objects as small as 5 microns (a micron is 1/1000 of 1 millimeter), such as plant cells and the single-celled organisms that swim around in pond water and puddles. This kit is great for people who want to get started quickly and experiment with the way their microscope is put together.\n\n\n\n\nLens Upgrades\n\nWe also have more advanced models for people who want to look at different things, take higher-quality photographs, and use stronger magnification lenses.\n\nEverything is designed to fit together, so if you start with the basic kit, there’s a clear upgrade path to better components later. But using a microscopic ruler, we found that even with the webcam version, you can see things as small as 5 microns wide -- 8x smaller than a human hair!\n\n\nMicroscope Plus & Super Microscope Kits\n\nThe next step up (the Plus Kit) includes an adapter to a 20x microscope objective lens -- enabling you to see much smaller objects with better optics. Because of the modular construction of our kit, you can simply swap in the lens and raise the platform to accommodate it. Our Super Microscope Kit will include a 40x lens.\n\n\nSee how the parts fit together in a modular system; the larger lenses replace the flipped webcam lens shown here, and all cameras and lenses are interchangeable:\n\n\nCamera Upgrades\n\nFor use with higher quality lenses, we also offer kits with upgraded cameras -- the Raspberry Pi camera.See how the parts fit together in a modular system; the larger lenses replace the flipped webcam lens shown here, and all cameras and lenses are interchangeable\n\n\nPi Camera Microscope Kit\n\nThe Pi Camera kit includes a much higher resolution Raspberry Pi camera (v1.3) -- at 5 megapixels. In this prototype we were testing rubber bands, but the final will feature springs along with its laser-cut acrylic platforms:\n\n\nAdditional higher-end versions like our Super and Deluxe Pi Camera Microscope Kits include up to 100x microscope lenses! And our Classroom Kit includes materials for a whole class of students to make five microscopes. \n\n2 micron sized particles through a Raspberry Pi microscope\n2 micron sized particles through a Raspberry Pi microscope\nHow did we get here?\n\nNot only does this kit build on the work of open source science groups like Parts & Crafts, Hackteria, Lifepatch and the Open Flexure Microscope project, but because of Public Lab\'s mission to address environmental problems that affect people, we also worked with communities who are facing air pollution which they hope to photograph with these kits.\n\n\nPublic Lab has been working with people across Wisconsin who’ve seen pollution from a boom in frac sand mining -- mining vast amounts of sand to use in oil and gas frac operations in other states. The especially worrisome part is a form of air pollution called respirable silica -- a fine, sharp-edged crystalline dust which can cause respiratory problems -- blowing over and into peoples homes and yards.\n\n\nAlthough many efforts to document pollution use expensive air samplers, lab tests and equipment, people living around the mines can see dust piling up on their windowsills and in their homes.\n\nSome community members sought a way to actually see these particles as small as 2.5 microns in size - an idea which led to the Community Microscope project. These photos could be used in advocacy and to raise awareness, but may also be helpful to see what particles are made of, just by examining them visually.\n\nHigh quality image taken using 100x lens and Raspberry Pi camera\nHigh quality image taken using 100x lens and Raspberry Pi camera\nWhy we need you\n\nNow we need you to take the next step. Community efforts like these only work if we build a broad, inclusive community of practice.\n\nThat means we need activists, educators, hobbyists, and professional scientists to join in, and work together. We need illustrators and writers to present these ideas clearly. Engineers and tinkerers to refine the open source kits! We need all kinds of skills and backgrounds, so this means you!\n\nHow can you get involved? We\'re building a list of challenges and goals, and need your help to:\n\ntry it out -- look at many different things! \ntroubleshoot and refine its assembly improve the lighting system \nidentify and address rough spots in the design \nproduce documentation and even curriculum \nteach workshops and host community events\nand much more to come!\nSign up for a kit today and help bring this project to life.\n\nA Do-It-Yourself approach\n\nPublic Lab, the open source community which launched the DIY spectrometer, the Balloon Mapping Kit, and the Infragram camera, has been working with community groups around the world who need affordable microscopes to photograph air pollutants, measure ocean microplastics, and identify other kinds of microscopic environmental problems.\n\nLuckily, many open source groups around the world -- like Hackteria and the OpenFlexure Microscope team, as well as folks in the Public Lab network -- have been working for years to make scientific research accessible to anyone who wants to participate.\n\nBuilding an alliance\n\nHow did these people all work together to get this far? Public Lab follows a coalition building model, where we connect people from around the world to cooperate on shared problems, like measuring air and water pollution. When communities facing pollution can team up with a larger community of makers, educators, and organizers, they can call in help, lead problem definition, and ensure that work is focused on a real-world problem.\n\n8 years of Public Lab\n\nWe\'ve worked with communities around the world for eight years -- since the BP oil disaster, and we\'ve run several Kickstarters to distribute affordable science tools to people who need them. \nRisks and challenges\n\nNOT “JUST A STORE”\n\nDistributing kits as we do, it’s always a risk that people will think of us as an online business, and not a growing community (and a non-profit) where their involvement is more important than the money they spend. We’re doing our best to communicate what we’re about through the story above, but we’re also dedicated to shaping the objects themselves, their boxes and packaging, to communicate this ethos. That said, we\'ve run five successful Kickstarters in this way, and have been distributing tens of thousands of kits around the world for eight years -- so it\'s not new to us!\n\nTACKLING CHALLENGES TOGETHER\n\nPart of the challenge of Public Lab work in general is to encourage people to share and build things together -- not just things they’ve done, but questions they want to ask, concerns they have, and requests for help. Sometimes it can feel like these are impositions on everyone else, but at Public Lab we celebrate them as the very foundation of the collaborative process. Sharing half-completed projects, doubts, and frustrations can help invite others into your work and strengthen it.\n\nOf course, it can also be a challenge to encourage people to report back when they do projects. These projects are about more than “tools” -- they’re about the stories that come from people adapting, reshaping, and applying them to a thousand different problems or scenarios. We’ll be highlighting many of the stories of people’s amazing work with balloon mapping kits\n\nFinally, these essentials -- engagement in collective brainstorming, troubleshooting, and sharing -- are even more important with the Prototyping Kits we\'re introducing. These kits have a range of issues and unknowns to tackle, and we’re counting on you all to get involved and put them through their paces.', '通过建立一套完整的寻找走失儿童体系，呼吁全国网民积极行动起来，并通过人脸识别技术帮助家长尽快找回失踪的孩子。', '2017-01-21 00:00:00', '80', '18221', '1', '【睿介寻子】通过人脸识别技术帮助走失的孩子早日回家', '2');

Ron perceived that independent animators were producing short films that were poignant and brilliant, but despite their brilliance, these films often went unnoticed in the U.S. Ron also felt that animated shorts, more than any other genre of film, took on the personality of their creators.  Because of this, they tended to evoke greater emotion and really connect with their audience.  He wanted to share this wealth of great animation with the wider animation industry. In 1999, he produced the first-ever Animation Show of Shows. \n\nFrom the very first Animation Show of Shows: “When the Day Breaks”, 1999 Canada, directed by Wendy Tilby and Amanda Forbis\nFrom the very first Animation Show of Shows: “When the Day Breaks”, 1999 Canada, directed by Wendy Tilby and Amanda Forbis\nDuring the early days of The Animation Show of Shows, Ron built on his relationships with animation festivals, studios, and leading college programs, which enabled him to discover still greater talent for inclusion in future shows. Each year, after curating the newest edition of the ASOS, he shared it with top animation studios, game and technology companies, and schools, helping to foster greater awareness of budding and amazingly talented animators. \n\nAnimators and their films can attain great acclaim. Two examples are “World of Tomorrow” 2015 by Don Hertzfeldt (USA) and “Everything” by David OReilly 2017 (USA).\nAnimators and their films can attain great acclaim. Two examples are “World of Tomorrow” 2015 by Don Hertzfeldt (USA) and “Everything” by David OReilly 2017 (USA).\nThe Animation Show of Shows continued to grow in size and status, and began to garner industry acclaim.  \n\n\nIn 2015, Ron felt it was finally time to take the show to the public. The Animation Show of Shows became a 501(c)(3) not for profit and ran its first campaign on Kickstarter to help fund an expansion into theaters and other public venues, and to allow the newly-formed not for profit to pay advance monies to the filmmakers for worldwide rights. \n\n\nThanks to generous support from industry professionals, students and fans of animation, the 17th Annual Animation Show of Shows premiered at venues in 47 cities, 4 countries, for a total of 435 showings. Since then, its reach has grown and fans of animation continue to support, through successive Kickstarter campaigns, the expansion of the Show into more venues. Every year since the 17th edition, those numbers have nearly doubled. The 19th Annual Animation Show of Shows is playing in theaters in North America with plans for additional international and educational expansion ...\n\n\nTWENTY YEARS - WOW! HOW TO CELEBRATE?\n\nWe are marking this celebratory occasion by producing, for the first time, TWO Animation Show of Shows - the 20th Annual Animation Show of Shows, and a \"Best Of\" Animation Show of Shows featuring the elite of  the elite from past shows. \n\nWe are also offering new and different Rewards, some that we\'ve never offered before. \n\n\"THE BEST OF\" COMPILATION\n\nSince inception, 38 of the films featured in the Animation Show of Shows went on to receive Oscar nominations.

I like to think that we bring that same incredible feeling to our public and academic audiences. As I reflect back on the past editions of Animation Show of Shows, I recall the same excitement and enthusiasm for all those audiences. Our preservation efforts in restoring animated shorts introduces our audiences to \"new older\" films, which we feature in the same way they were intended to be seen when they were new.\"\n\nTwo independent animated shorts that have become all-time fan favorites, with cult-like adoration: “Cat Came Back” by Cordel Barker 1988 (Canada);  “Hangman” by Paul Julian & Les Goldman 1964 (USA)\nTwo independent animated shorts that have become all-time fan favorites, with cult-like adoration: “Cat Came Back” by Cordel Barker 1988 (Canada); “Hangman” by Paul Julian & Les Goldman 1964 (USA)\n\n\"I\'m truly honored to be celebrating 20 years of the Animation Show of Shows. It\'s been fulfilling to be entrusted by the filmmakers with their films and by the audiences with their time. It\'s also very difficult, and what I mean is – these works are often by young animators, always brimming with passion, overflowing with talent, but lacking in money and anticipating being discovered. As the number of films produced each year has grown, the process of selecting which films to invite in the show has become tougher. I often wish I could include more films, and add to my support and appreciation for what these young artists can create. The support we have been able to show for the independent animator is a direct result of the support we\'ve received on Kickstarter and from the community of fans of exemplary animated shorts. We will continue to do what we do, and hope you will continue to support our efforts, our shows, and the animated short film. Thank you for the opportunity to have this celebration.\" - Ron', 'We curate and produce an annual feature length film, comprised of the best and newest animated shorts.

Here’s a look behind the scenes:   \n\nTemperature on Demand\n\nPico U creates rich and flavorful beverages using precise temperature control.

Water is distributed evenly over the top of the coffee, first blooming the grounds, then completing the brew for perfect results every time.\n\n\nFusion Control  \n\nWhen you load a PicoPak or PicoPak Mini into your Pico U, it sends the brewing mixture to the right place at the right time to accurately follow your preprogrammed recipe. The Pico U\'s multi-flow-manifold allows second-to-second control of what ingredients get infused into the brew.\n\n\nWith up to 4 stages in one recipe, Pico U can use high heat and flow rates to extract rich flavors, and then mellow things out to tease out subtle aromas without overheating delicate ingredients.  \n\nThis powerful feature enables a multi-stage hops boil while brewing beer, and empowers a world of creativity when brewing fusion beverages from infused coffees and teas to kombucha and beyond.\n\nBetter Beer Through Technology\n\nWhen you connect your keg and start brewing one of your own craft beer creations, or one of our award winning PicoPaks, there’s a lot going on behind the scenes. Powerful pumps and heating elements sanitize internal components and bring the water up to temperature, while an array of sensors monitor the process. An onboard processor maintains the heartbeat of the brew and connects to your online account to make sure all parts of the process are accurately delivered, just how you ordered them.\n\n\nMeet Our Brewery Partners\n\nOur brewery partners inspire us every day!

We\'ve received so many awards in fact, that Fast Company recently named PicoBrew as the 10th Most Innovative Food Company in the World! Speaking of innovation, we have 5 patents on our technology and 12 additional patents pending.  \n\nWe founded PicoBrew in 2010 with the vision of democratizing craft beer by allowing anyone to brew delicious craft beer, leveraging the expertise of the craft beer community. In 2013, we launched the world\'s first fully automatic all-grain beer brewing appliance, the PicoBrew Zymatic. After two more years of hard work we launched the PicoBrew Pico (Model S), the world\'s first true consumer countertop craft beer appliance, and invented the PicoPak compostable grains and hops recipe pack, as well as partnerships with hundreds of craft brewers around the world. In 2017, we unleashed our simplest and most affordable craft brewing appliance, the Pico Model C, which built on 7 years of pioneering and leadership in the craft beer space. This past year, we launched the Z Series, a professional-grade, all-grain brewing appliance line for professional brewers.  \n\nThis is our fifth Kickstarter, and we’ve got nothing but love for our Kickstarter backers!

Since our first Pico model, we’ve been working with one of the world’s leading contract manufacturers. We’ve learned how to design for manufacture, build stringent factory tests, manage demand, and scale quickly. Even so, risks remain:\n\nMANUFACTURING: We’re doing some novel things to reduce cost, like designing and building our own low pressure brewing kegs with custom hose connectors. We’ve gotten pretty good at working with our factories to bring unique new products to market, but there are always manufacturing schedule risks for any product.\n\nFULFILLMENT: We experienced some challenges in shipping Zymatic, Kegsmarts, Pico, and Picopaks though our shipping partners—shipping large heavy packages and keeping the contents safe from us to you is not easy. Fortunately, we have learned a lot about how to make this work, but getting products in volume fulfilled worldwide is still non-trivial.\n\nINTERNATIONAL: Getting government regulatory approval for worldwide products remains a challenge, and again, part of the reason for partnering with Flex is that they’re really good at this.\n\nHelp us make Pico U a reality with your pledge today!\n\nTHANK YOU for your support!', 'Brew beyond craft beer with a single appliance that crafts coffee, tea, kombucha, dry soda, fusion, energy, and health drinks.', '2017-03-01 00:00:00', '150', '3530', '0', 'Pico U.

INSERT INTO `item` VALUES ('16', '400', 'About\n\n>>CLICK AQUÍ PARA VERSIÓN EN ESPAÑOL<<\n\nHey Kickstarter! Two years ago, we came up with an idea about how to create a new kind of flip book. We wanted to upgrade the classic format and bring it to a whole new level, and this is the result:\n\nMolecularis is also an animated coloring book. You can use it in plenty of ways, by coloring, redrawing and varying its content with an endless number of possibilities. Use pencils, markers, watercolors, graphite, brushes, technical pens or whatever technique you prefer. \n\n\nBy alternating the colors gradually from one picture to the next and using your favorite color palette, you can not only give the sequences their very own personality, but also bring them to life – as you see them ‘move’ when you flip through the pages.\n\nInside Molecularis, you’ll find a group of small and restless organisms that interact with each other as if they were being observed through a microscope.\n\nLike all flip books, Molecularis relies on the principle of persistence of vision, which in other words, is exactly what your eyes and brain do when you watch a movie. In a flip book, every picture varies gradually from one page to the next, so by flipping the pages with your thumb, they generate the illusion of movement. This simple technique has been around since 1868 and played an important role in the birth of cinema.\n\nBecause the sequences are loop animated, after coloring or redrawing, you can create GIFs like this!\n\n\nThe sequences were designed and animated by Jossie Malis, co-founder of Flipboku and best known for his award-winning animated series Bendito Machine. Maybe you\'ve come across this video from the first flip book we created for the show a couple of years ago. Find out more here.\n\nIf you observe the flip book in closer detail, you will notice that the edges are cut in a specific way, so that you can swap between the different sequences. This is the key to the optical illusion that gives Molecularis its unique feature of showing you six different animations in just one flip book. You\'ll have a blast watching people\'s faces when they see Molecularis for the first time and try to understand how it works! :D\n\nAnd here\'s the secret: it all depends on the position of your thumb. You can switch between sequences by placing your thumb either in the upper corner, the center or the lower corner of the front edge of the book.\n\nAs there are 3 sequences on each side of the book, the images are arranged alternately. This means that you will have sequences 1, 2 and 3 on one side and 4, 5 and 6 when you turn the book around. To proceed with the coloring simply follow each sequence by jumping every 3 pages. You will have better control of the coloring process if you follow each animated element in every sequence. \n\nEvery single Molecularis is largely hand-produced and the whole process requires a number of steps that rely on careful supervision. We spent a lot of time testing different paper qualities and consulted with several experts until we found the perfect match: high quality 100% recycled heavy paper with a semi-rough surface and a nice smooth finish. It\'s suitable for all kinds of different techniques and prevents colors from passing through it. Each Molecularis comes with 180 pages (90 sheets). \n\n We have a weakness for good packaging, and that’s why we included a sleek slip case to keep your Molecularis safe after you use it. It prevents the pages from wearing out and by the way, it looks awesome on your shelf or wherever you want to keep it.\n\nAs a perfect complement to Molecularis we have created a learning flip book for anyone who wants to try ‘freestyle’ animation::  \n\n\nBlanko is a flip book that contains 320 blank pages on which you can animate whatever comes to your mind. If you\'re new to animation, learn how to get started with 6 of the basic principles we have included: squash and stretch, anticipation, ease in - ease out, arcs, timing and exaggeration. You can use both sides of the flip book.\n\nWatch this terrific animation by our good friend Nacho Rodríguez created on Blanko, featuring his character Mr. Coo:\n\n project video thumbnail PLAY\n\nMolecularis and Blanko make a great couple, that\'s why we have bundled them up in a practical and sleek protective sleeve.

Since 2009, more than five hundred poetry projects have come to life with the help of the readers and poetry lovers on Kickstarter. We’ve seen chapbooks like No Experiences, anthologies like Anchored in Deep Water, translations such as Then Come Back (the lost poems of Pablo Neruda), a live performance series from Button Poetry, and even a poetic tarot deck.\n\nIn June, we’re launching our first-ever Summer of Poetry, a season-long celebration featuring amazing new projects and poets for you to discover, poetry readings on Kickstarter Live, and events at our Brooklyn HQ.

I was immediately drawn to the incredible variety of tones and the diverse vocal ability that emanated through each song, which captured my attention and took me on a lifelong journey into the many musical worlds of Al Jarreau. \n\nThis musical journey included the genres of Orchestral, Jazz, Pop and R&B. Needless to say, I was hooked from day one and began to vocalize along with his many recordings. In addition, I learned how to play most of his songs simply by listening, which all originated from my training in both the church and from my father, Charles Walker Sr.’s gospel group, The Walker Brothers.  \nAs with any project, there is a possibility for risk. However, we have a great team of industry professionals collaborating on this project, and a solid executable plan for every part of the process.

It causes no damage to the soil and when done correctly it improves the health of the earth.\n\nOrganic matter and environment are key to successful composting.  \"Biodegradable\" and \"compostable\" items often do not degrade in landfills as the environment is unsuitable and contains large amounts of inorganic waste. This is why composting is so important! \n\nPurchasing sustainable goods alone is not enough to help keep our earth a beautiful place. We must learn how to refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle, and rot (or compost!) these items properly, and work to create change in systems at large. \n\nWhy would you want to compost?\n\nSupplies much needed nutrient rich soil for farms across the country (which is important if you enjoy eating good tasting food)\nTo keep rotting waste out of landfills which create harmful methane gases\nIt reduces our need for chemical fertilizers\nLowers your carbon footprint\nHelps retain moisture and supresses plant diseases and pests, which means you use less water on crops and gardens  — i.e. we all save money!\nCuts down on the smelly-ness of your garbage bins\nHow can I start?\n\n\nComposting in your freezer: (free, easiest & city friendly) This is the simplest and easiest way to compost at home. You put a container with a lid on it in your freezer. Fill it with food scraps and when it\'s full drop it off at your local farmer\'s market (many cities offer free drop off at Farmer\'s markets). Here\'s a link to Chicago\'s free drop-offs.  \nPick-up Service: If you don\'t have time or space to start composting in your back yard, pick up services are a great option.
